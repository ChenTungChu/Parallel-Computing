# Parallel-Computing

These projects are based from ECE 5720 courses. During the class, we learned the fundamentals of parallel computing.
We have implemented matrix-vector and matrix-matrix multiplication in different ways, from serial to parallel. We evaluated the process time and speed with several parallel computing approaches, including pthreads, openMP, MPI, and CUDA.
